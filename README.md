GPIO Expander-based LED and Solenoid Control using I2C.

GPIO Expander LED & Solenoid Control
This project provides implementations for controlling LEDs and solenoids using a GPIO expander over I2C. 

It includes:

GPIO Expander LED Control: Enables LED toggling, brightness adjustment, and status checking.

GPIO Expander Solenoid Control: Manages solenoid activation and deactivation.

Features:
✔ I2C communication for GPIO expanders
✔ LED control (on/off, brightness)
✔ Solenoid control (activation/deactivation)
✔ Efficient and optimized C code
